# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns

##Overview of Project:

Client is an up and coming playwright wants to start first fundraising campaign. She needs help to organize and analyze data gathered in an excel spreadsheet.  The analysis will help to uncover trends in the data.

##Purpose

The purpose of the project overall is to see what makes a project's campaign successful and also what makes a campaign fail.  We are attempting to project the best times to start a kickstarter campaign.

##Analysis and Challenges:

The analysis was created using datasets in creating pivot tables and then to create graphical charts
to be able to visualize the trends in the data.  A few challenges was finding what data should be used, creating new datasets, and extracting what data would be useful.  An additional challenge was being sure the calculations and formulas were correct.  Overcoming some of the difficulties was to take things step by step, but also to backtrack again in correcting any mistakes.

##Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

Outcomes based on the launch date reveals that there was a higher chance of success if launched in the months of May and June when following the data trend.  The month of October seemed to show the highest rate of failure based on the launch date.  The best time for a launch date would be in May, while the worse time to launch would be in October.

##Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:

When reviewing the outcomes based on goals, a goal of less than $1000 has a 76 percent chance of being successful.  There is however a 67 percent chance when the dollar amount goal is between $35000 and $45000.  The goal with the dollar amounts between $45000 and $50000 have a 100 percent chance of failure.

##Results, Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:

The dataset does not show the type of plays or whether the money comes from a particular type of donor.  We could also narrow the results further country to country to see if plays are more popular in certain areas.  We could use a line graph to see if money is coming more from a particular country.
